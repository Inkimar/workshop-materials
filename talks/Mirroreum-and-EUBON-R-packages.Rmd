## EUBON - the challenge

- The challenge in EUBON - silos in [WP 1-8](http://www.eubon.eu/show/work/packages_3568/)
- Integration of workflows and processes **across work packages** and systems integration
- Example: How to get biodiversity analysis tools into WP1 and 2 - web portal?

## Traditional approach

**One ring to rule them all** - one Centralized System

May work locally - but internationally? Practical challenges:

- Different ways to work - **"cultural" diversity**
- Teams, time zones, languages, tools, methods
- Code of conduct - don't control others - mutually beneficial collaboration 
- Reality: funding provided on project basis - does it give sustainable platforms?
- The results - a paper is published and the project ends

## More modern approach

Decentralized international collaboration over Internet

- How do people work today - in software?
- FOSS Data Science tools like R, ROpenSci
- Versioning and git + GitHub
- Not one single system - but several in concert, integrated

The Internet - As polyglot environment, using open Internet protocols and standards as common ground

## Rationale for Mirroreum

"How to share work on the raquamaps package - an open source implementation of Aqua Maps?"

- Mi **ROR** eum - reflecting **R**eproducible **O**pen **R**esearch
- Shoestring (no) budget at all for licenses, hardware etc - use existing infrastructure
- Attemt to integrate and provide a web ui for biodiversity analysis research - just log in at a web site and get a full-features platform for authoring and publishing reproducible open research
- Reuse existing widely used open source tools from the research community and stay away from non-open non-free licenses
- "Can you run all of it on your laptop, the same bits, off-line?"

## FOSS approach - tools

- Use R for reproducible research workflows
- Use Docker for systems integration - to reduce footprint, minimize dependencies and lock-in
- Provide portable packagings for increased freedom to create/innovate
- Allow any FOSS Data Science tools - Python, Julia, Spark etc
- Mirroreum: Web-based biodiversity analysis frontend - Bundle R + ROpenSci + other packages
- Can use any data source on the Internet can provide data, including
	- GBIF's web APIs through ALA4R
	- Atlas of Living Australia's web APIs through rgbif
	- Other Web APIs
	- Any other source open for use (open science != commercial secrets?)
	- Closed sources such as traditional databases

## Typical collaboration workflow

Create an R or Python package with data, web ui and tutorial

- Build a package - include data, web ui, tutorial (vignette)
- Author a reproducible research paper using the above
- When stable, publish/release package to ...
	- GitHub 
	- RForge 
	- ROpenSci
	- CRAN

## Local customizations and integrations

- Not all R packages are on CRAN or ROpenSci (yet!) for various reasons
- Packages on GitHub - with local or regional adaptations, work in progress
- Custom data sources
- Re-bundle with Docker - base images extended with various extra packages and configurations

## Microservices architecture with Docker

- Mirroreum is the web-based frontend - deploy locally or regionally - this client is not tightly coupled to backend services, can use any services but is pre-configured for regional data services
- Bundles **rgbif** and **ALA4R** configs - allows (pre-)configured R clients to connect to regional services
- Deploy local and/or regional data services based on open-source GBIF and ALA components
- Anyone can pull components and run anywhere - combine like LEGO

## DevOps systems integration workflow

- Assemble packages - bundle into binary images with Docker (the src in Dockerfiles)
- Build and push those images to Docker Hub
	- Example: [raquamaps related components at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/raquamaps/)
	- Example: [DINA-Web related components at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/dina)
- Deploy images on servers
	- Web UI running for example here: [swedishbirdrecoveries](https://birdringing.dina-web.net)
