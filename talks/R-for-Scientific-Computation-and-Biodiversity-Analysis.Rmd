## Collaborating using R - "Units"

- **Scripts** - describe steps in your workflow, can re-run and reproducing results, by calling **Functions** - which encapsulates re-usable ways to process **datasets**

- **R Packages** - encapsulates a larger unit of work, including:
	- Datasets
	- Documentation of datasets
	- Functions
	- Documentation of functions
	- Tutorials showing workflows involving data using the functions
	- Web UIs
	- License
	
## Collaboration using R - "Processes"

- Use git and GitHub or equivalent public online respository for publishing source code
- Publish data to the Internet - enable others to use your datasets
- Write books together - collaborate and use markdown, see [bookdown](https://bookdown.org)

## Biodiversity Analysis

- More than just computations or showing visuals - it is about the whole narrative and explaining the results
- Involves several reproducible steps:
	- processing data from different sources
	- modelling / computations
	- presenting results, while enabling peer-review to build trust in results
	- tutorials/documentation - explaining to peers how to reproduce results, enabling peer-review

- ROpenSci offers many excellent packages for biodiversity analysis (but also for many other disciplines)

## Scientific Computations

Functions may involve scientific calculations - models etc...

- FP vs OOP - Functional Programming versus Object-Oriented Programming - focus on VERBs not NOUNs, less of side-effects and state contrasting with Object Oriented paradigm where focus is on NOUNs not VERBs and the data and algorithms often carries a lot of state and side-effects of one method to other objects in the system are often plenty and difficult to control and understand
- Designing R functions for calculations - well situated for scaling and doing computations in parallel at scale
- Look at [OpenCPU](www.opencpu.org)

## Presenting results from computations

- Visualization
- Communicate results clearly
- Create a Shiny web app as part of your R package

## Use Data Science Open Source Tools

- Docker - for running anything anywhere
- ROpenSci-packages - for Biodiversity Analysis tools
- OpenCPU - for exposing data as a service
- Shiny - for providing a web based interactive user interface
- Various R packages - create your own or use existing:
	- rgbif
	- bookdown
	- figshare
	- dryad
