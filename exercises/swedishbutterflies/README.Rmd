## swedishbutterflies

There is a publicly available dataset that Bengt at the Swedish Museum of Natural History has worked on for a long time, recording data over known presence for a set of butterfly species across some Swedish landscapes.

Here it is: http://www2.nrm.se/en/CATLEP2003.xls

- Could this dataset be distributed as an R package? Why or why not?
